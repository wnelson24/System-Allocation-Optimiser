A quantitative capital allocation tool for multi-strategy trading portfolios.

This script takes equity curve data from individually backtested trading systems (e.g., from QuantConnect) and computes robust capital allocation weights using a composite of:

Kelly Criterion – maximizes expected geometric growth
Hierarchical Risk Parity (HRP) – clusters uncorrelated systems and recursively allocates
Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) – minimizes tail risk under extreme events
Designed for systematic traders allocating capital across strategies with differing durations, performance profiles, and risk characteristics.

Features

Paste equity data directly from QuantConnect reports (tabular format)
Automatically aligns systems with different start/end dates
Calculates daily returns from equity curves
Computes three sets of weights: Kelly, HRP, CVaR
Outputs a composite weighted allocation (default: 50% Kelly, 30% HRP, 20% CVaR)
Works entirely in the terminal or IDLE (no file uploads required)

You can adjust weighting blend.
